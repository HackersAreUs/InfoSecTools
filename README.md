<p>
<b>Wordlist Manipulator (wm)</b> will take your existing wordlists and perform
desired manipulation techniques. WM will read your existing wordlist one
word per line, letter by letter, converting each character to desired technique.
Currently, some of the techniques available are case options, prefix, append, 
wpa conversion, and wordlist optimization.New techniques are still being added.

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This is my first small project. I am constantly messing around with my wordlists
using the linux built-in commands such as cat, grep, awk, sort, etc. Began learning 
Python and I thought it would be a perfect practice project plus creating something
that I will actually use on regular basis. If someone can benefit from it that is
definitely a plus. Go easy on my coding, remember, learning in progress.<br>
